I&#39;m emailing you to let you know that I would like to request reinstatement. I never realized how poorly I was doing this semester and I should have been more aware of my grades.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This second semester was one of the toughest times of my life, and I&#39;m not exaggerating or anything. I was put in several family situations that pushed my limits. The biggest issue was that my parents are finally getting a divorce and they do not get along at all, so I had to be in the person in the middle to help them solve their issues. It was a very stressful situation that had its tolls on me. I was more worried about their divorce and helping them get everything figured out than anything else going on (school, work, friends, etcetera). To this current day, they are still in the process of their divorce and I&#39;m packing all of my mom&#39;s things for her since she is out of the state and trying to talk to my dad about filing since they refuse to talk to each other and it&#39;s still very difficult. Then, with all of that going on, my mom miscarried her baby three&nbsp;months ago and almost passed away herself, from her weak kidney&#39;s and clotting in her lungs. That was a whole other level of what I had to do to help my family. I considered taking time off then to go help everyone out, but figured I should finish the semester out. I know this is all very personal, but I took all this stuff very hard. Family is the most important thing to me and knowing that my future sibling was miscarried, my mom almost passes away and the divorce, I was crumbling fast and this just kind of adds to it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I had to address these issues head on. I would be in contact with my mom asking her what she needed from the house and what information she needed from my dad and then I&#39;d call him up and ask him what he needed. That was what I did everyday to sort things out and make everything easier on them and my brother and sister. What resulted was anger from my parents taking it out on me because the divorce wasn&#39;t going anywhere and that put a lot more stress on me. Hearing that my mom was pregnant and she lost the baby made me really upset, but I dealt with that fine. I just had to spend a lot of my time convincing my mom that everything was going to be okay. The final straw was hearing that my mom almost passed away from blood clotting in her lungs and her kidney&#39;s giving out. I got the phone call from a coworker of hers and they said she was in the hospital. This is the second time she&#39;s nearly died and both times crushed me. I stopped going to class and stopped doing everything because I was worried about her and I was upset I couldn&#39;t be there for her or go see her in the hospital. I never really addressed that issue because it&#39;s something I continue to worry about with her.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;â€‹I understand my grades at the end of the fall semester were not outstanding at all, but I tried to work harder this semester and that&#39;s something I promised myself and the school that I would do - work hard. But it was difficult to pick myself up after everything that was thrown at my family this semester. I&#39;m hoping that at the end of the summer my parents will be divorced and all their issues will be settled (and that would take a ton of stress off of me). I know I need to work ten times harder to keep my promise to myself and the school and pick up all my slack. If I get reinstated (I&#39;m hoping and praying I do), I plan to only focus on school. I can&#39;t get involved in everything around me - I just need to focus on myself and my grades and I wholeheartedly promise to do that. I need to not involve myself in too much family drama, like I had over the spring semester). I have all these goals that I need to accomplish and I can&#39;t do that if I don&#39;t go to school. I really need this for myself and it&#39;s never been so clear that I need to not let myself get down in a slump and just not go to my classes because something is happening in the family. I need to push myself. So, please, please reinstate me for the 2015-16 fall semester. I need school to help me prioritize things in my life and keep me on track. It may not sound like the best idea for me to return this coming semester to whoever is reading this, but I know myself and I know that this is exactly what I need. Please.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Thank you for reading,</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Tessa Baumann</p>\r\n
